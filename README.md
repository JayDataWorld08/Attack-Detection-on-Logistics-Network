Zero-Day Attack Detection on Logistics Network
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This repository contains the Zero-Day Attack Detection system developed as part of the ITC6000 â€“ Database Management Systems course. The project focuses on detecting and analyzing cyber threats within airport logistics networks using SQLite and structured database design.

The system models real-world scenarios for Security Analysts, IT Administrators, Logistics Managers, and Compliance Officers to monitor, detect, and respond to anomalies in real time.
